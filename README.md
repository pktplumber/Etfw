# ETFW
Embedded template framework: A memory safe application framework for embedded systems.

## Why
While the standard library is very useful, it uses dynamic memory allocation under the hood which is often unsafe and innefficient for safety-critical embedded systems.  Using the ETL library (https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl), this library aims to provide users a "plug and play" embedded application framework for quick and safe development.

## Inspiration
The ETFW aims to address the short-comings of existing embedded frameworks such as NASA's cFE and fPrime while still providing standard library adjacent features from the embedded template library.
