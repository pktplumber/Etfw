This folder contains the code for a sample executive application. The ExecApp is responsible for initializing and managing all applications. This includes providing command and status messages to control and monitor application run states.

If the user would rather build a custom executive application, this code can be ignored. It's still suggested to use the "AppExecutor" class for managing application storage.
