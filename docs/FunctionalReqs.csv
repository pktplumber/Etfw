Summary,Description,Rationale,,,
Svc,ETFW shall allow users to create and run statically allocated applications.,,,,
Svc: Application Registration,ETFW shall support applications defined and configured at compile time.,,,,
Svc: App Registration,"ETFW shall register applications to an internal, run-time container.",,,,
Svc: Static App Registration,ETFW shall allow users to register applications statically at compile time.,,,,
Svc: App configuration,"ETFW applications shall be configured with the following parameters: Name, Unique ID, run-type (passive or task based), enabled at startup flag",,,,
Svc: Passive app,ETFW shall support apps that do not require a thread separate from the main ETFW thread.,,,,
Svc: Active app,ETFW shall support asynchronous apps that run in a thread separate from the main ETFW thread.,,,,
Svc: Active app configuration,"In addition to common app configuration, ETFW active apps shall be configured with the following parameters: task stack size, task priority.",,,,
Svc: Static app configs,ETFW applications shall only be configured statically with compile time definitions.,,,,
Svc: Start all applications,ETFW shall start all registered applications that are enabled at startup at startup,,,,
Svc: Start individual application,"Upon request, ETFW shall start an individual application if it is registered and not already started",,,,
Svc: Stop individual application,"Upon request, ETFW shall stop an individual application if it is registered and started.",,,,
Svc: App initialization,ETFW shall call an application's user defined initialization function before starting the app.,,,,
Svc: App initialization error,ETFW shall not start an application if it's initialization function returns an error.,,,,
Svc: App cleanup,ETFW shall call an application's user defined cleanup function before stopping the app.,,,,
Svc: App state,"ETFW app's shall have an internal state with the following possible values: created, initialized, running, started, stopped, exited, and error.",,,,
Svc: App state - Created,"An app's state shall be set to ""Created"" if the app has not been initialized or started, or the app is not running and the app's cleanup function has been called successfully.",,,,
Svc: App state - Initialized,"An app's state shall be set to ""Initialized"" if the app's initialization function has been called successfully, is not started, or has stopped/exited without error.",,,,
Svc: App state - Starting,"An app's state shall be set to ""Starting"" if the app has been initialized, is an active application, and the app's start function has been called but the app task is not currently running.",,,,
Svc: App state - Running,"An app's state shall be set to ""Running"" if the app has been initialized and started successfully and has not been stopped or exited.",,,,
Svc: App state - Stopped,"An app's state shall be set to ""Stopped"" if the app was previously in the running state and was stopped by the ETFW.",,,,
Svc: App state - Exited,"An app's state shall be set to ""Exited"" if the app is of the active type, was previously running, and has exited it's task loop. ",,,,
Svc: App state - Error,"An app's state shall be set to ""Error"" if the app's initialization or start functions failed or the app reported an error indicating it cannot proceed.",,,,
Svc: Report app config list,"Upon request, ETFW shall write all register applications' name, ID, enabled at startup flag and run type (passive vs active) to a user specified file.",,,,
Svc: Child service,ETFW shall allow applications to spawn child services,,,,
Svc: Child service run type,ETFW child services shall only be ran as tasks/asynchronously.,Any operations that can run synchronously with the parent application do not need to be started as a task.,,,
Svc: Child service configuration,"ETFW child services shall be configured with the following parameters: unique ID (w.r.t. to other child classes started by the parent app), name, task stack size, and task priority.",,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Config: Max number of apps,ETFW shall allow the user to configure the maximum number of applications allowed to be registered at one time.,,,,
,,,,,
Msg: App communication,ETFW Apps shall have the ability to send and receive messages between one another.,,,,
